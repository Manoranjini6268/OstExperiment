If you want to manage *versioning* and *branching* on GitHub without using the terminal, you can do it through the GitHub website. Here's how:

## *Versioning with Tags*
1. *Navigate to Your Repository*:
   - Open your repository on GitHub.

2. *Go to the Releases Section*:
   - Click on the *"Releases"* link in the right-hand menu or go to the *Code* tab and click *Releases* from the bar above the files.

3. *Create a New Release*:
   - Click the *"Draft a new release"* button.

4. *Add a Tag*:
   - In the *"Tag version"* field, enter the version number (e.g., v1.0.0).
   - Select a branch to tag (usually main).

5. *Add Release Details*:
   - Provide a *title* and an optional *description*.
   - You can attach release assets (e.g., binaries, files) if needed.

6. *Publish the Release*:
   - Click *"Publish release"* to create the tag and release.

## *Branching*
1. *Navigate to Your Repository*:
   - Open your repository on GitHub.

2. *View Branches*:
   - Click the *"Code"* tab, then click the dropdown that says *"main"* (or your default branch name) near the top-left.

3. *Create a New Branch*:
   - In the dropdown, type the name of the new branch (e.g., feature/new-feature).
   - Click *"Create branch"*.

4. *Switch Between Branches*:
   - Use the same dropdown to select and switch between branches.

5. *Edit and Commit Code in a Branch*:
   - Navigate to the branch where you want to make changes.
   - Use GitHubâ€™s web editor:
     - Open the file you want to edit.
     - Click the *pencil icon* to edit.
     - Make changes and *commit* them to your branch.

6. *Create a Pull Request (PR)*:
   - After making changes, click *"Pull requests"* in the repository menu.
   - Click *"New pull request"*.
   - Choose the source branch (e.g., feature/new-feature) and the target branch (e.g., main).
   - Add a title and description, then click *"Create pull request"*.

7. *Merge the Branch*:
   - After reviewing the PR, click *"Merge pull request"*.
   - Delete the branch using the *"Delete branch"* button if it's no longer needed.

## *Best Practices*
- Use meaningful branch names:
  - Example: feature/add-user-login, bugfix/fix-typo.
- Use the *Pull Request template* (if configured in your repo) to ensure proper documentation for merges.
- Always test changes in a branch before merging into the main branch.
